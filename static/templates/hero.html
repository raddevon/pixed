            <p>Every year, I will select a charity to receive <strong>10% of the proceeds from Pixed subscriptions</strong>. My first selection is a very personal one.</p>
            <p>My wife of four years was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis before she and I met. She's been living with the disease for over seven years now. Although she's doing well, MS has put her life and the range of experiences available to her in a box. At the moment, the box is pretty large, but it's limiting nonetheless.</p>
            <p>I chose to support the <strong><a href="http://www.nationalmssociety.org/index.aspx" target=_new>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</a></strong> in hopes they will be able to continue to make the lives of my wife and other sufferers as full and unimpeded as possible. Perhaps someday, the disease can be eradicated so that victims can come out of their boxes and do all the things they couldn't before.</p>
